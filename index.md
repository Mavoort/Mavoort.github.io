Welcome to my Blog!

This site is currently under construction.
I plan to write regular posts about applied mathematics.

Welcome to **Mathematics Weekly**!

I make educational content about scientific computing and applied mathematics,
covering topics such as

- Computational Physics,
- Machine Learning,
- Quantitative Finance,
- and Math for Game Development.

Classical lectures can sometimes be too abstract and theoretical, giving you the formulas and theorems without any real-world examples.
My aim is to give a good balance between theory and application, by deriving the equations and algorithms, but also implementing them in Python or Julia.

As the physicist Richard Feynman once said:

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

So if you have ever wondered how to actually implement a finite element solver,
how to write a neural network from scratch, or how to develop a ray tracer,
then this blog is for you!
