  abstract = {We revisit the classic supporting hyperplane illustration of the duality gap for non-convex optimization problems. It is refined by dissecting the duality gap into two terms: the first measures the degree of near-optimality in a Lagrangian relaxation, while the second measures the degree of near-complementarity in the Lagrangian relaxed constraints. We also give an example of how this dissection may be exploited in the design of a solution approach within discrete optimization.},
